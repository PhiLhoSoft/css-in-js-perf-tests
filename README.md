# CSS-in-js Performance tests

Testing a couple of CSS in JS libraries, check [the source folder](./src/cases) for the different tests.

And read why we did these tests [here](https://engineering.hellofresh.com/the-css-in-js-battle-89c34a7a83ea).

## Usage

You can clone this repository, `npm install` and run `npm run bench` to run the tests yourself.

To set the amount of iterations you can set an environment variable called `ITERATIONS`. This will result in: `ITERATIONS=100 npm run bench`.

## Specs

The specs from the machine on which the tests were run:

```
$ node -v
v6.3.0

$ /usr/sbin/system_profiler SPHardwareDataType
Hardware:

    Hardware Overview:

      Model Name: MacBook Pro
      Model Identifier: MacBookPro12,1
      Processor Name: Intel Core i7
      Processor Speed: 3,1 GHz
      Number of Processors: 1
      Total Number of Cores: 2
      L2 Cache (per Core): 256 KB
      L3 Cache: 4 MB
      Memory: 16 GB
```

## Results

The first test is just a simple render test, generate 2 class names, one for a container and one for a button.

```
Running simple test.

jss length 447
jss-without-preset length 443
glamor length 422

  fela               x 78,413 ops/sec ±2.26% (72 runs sampled)
  
Fastest is: fela
```

The second test overloads on styles, so it adds `n (ITERATIONS)` amount of different styles for the button.

```
Running styles overload test.

  fela               x 14,934 ops/sec ±2.69% (76 runs sampled)

Fastest is: fela,styletron
```

The third test overloads on class names, so it adds `n (ITERATIONS)` amount of different class names with the same styles. This test is interesting to see which library actually merges these styles when they're similar.

```
Running classes overload test.
